# Changelog

## [3.27.0] - 2023-08-28

- Fix: Columns of type `short` are now correctly 16 bit, previously they were
  considered to be 8 bits, resulting in unexpected overflow.
  - Note that this fix could cause newly appearing breaks in behavior if you
    have a legacy FGB file (written with version `<= 3.26.0`) which contains a
    `short` column, because all subsequent property columns would be
    incorrectly offset.
- Fix `size` inconsistency with `linestring_begin` (#287)
- Breaking: Remove lifetimes from FgbReader/FgbWriter
- FgbReader/FgbWriter as well as borrow, can now own their inner reader/writer
- Breaking: Replace pub dim field of FeatureWriter with constructor
- Bump deps & 2021 edition, reexports, clippy (#282)
- Upgrade to geozero 0.11
